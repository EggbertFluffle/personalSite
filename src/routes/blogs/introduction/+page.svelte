<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a simple introduction to me and the site. You can find a more detailed synopsis of myself in the &lt;WhoAmI\&gt; section. I plan to just use this as a place to throw in things that I&#39;m working on, cool stuff I&#39;m studying or really anything else I feel like writing about. As of writing this the site is defenitly a WIP but I think in time it should look much better. As of now the site is written in <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Svelte-Kit</a> and I&#39;m using <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5</a> and <a href="https://p5-svelte.netlify.app/">p5-svelte</a> to render the splash animation, finnaly <a href="https://marked.js.org/">marked</a> to convert each blog, written in markdown, into HTML. There should be a place to preview projects and contact me but for now e-mail is fine, hdiambrosio@gmail.com. Now have a blessed day :). </p>
