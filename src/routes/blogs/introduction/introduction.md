# Introduction

This is a simple introduction to me and the site. You can find a more detailed synopsis of myself in the \<WhoAmI\> section. I plan to just use this as a place to throw in things that I'm working on, cool stuff I'm studying or really anything else I feel like writing about. As of writing this the site is defenitly a WIP but I think in time it should look much better. As of now the site is written in [Svelte-Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and I'm using [p5](https://p5js.org/) and [p5-svelte](https://p5-svelte.netlify.app/) to render the splash animation, finnaly [marked](https://marked.js.org/) to convert each blog, written in markdown, into HTML. There should be a place to preview projects and contact me but for now e-mail is fine, hdiambrosio@gmail.com. Now have a blessed day :).
