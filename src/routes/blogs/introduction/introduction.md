# Introduction

This is a simple introduction to me and the site. You can find a more detailed synopsis of myself in the \<WhoAmI\> section. I plan to just use this as a place to throw in things that I'm working on, cool stuff I'm studying or really anything else I feel like writing about. As of writing this the site is defenitly a WIP but I think in time it should look much better. The site is written with [Svelte-Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), using a static adapter. There should be a place to preview projects and contact me but for now e-mail is fine (hdiambrosio@gmail.com). I encourage you to poke around ro reach out, have a good day :)
