# Introducing... BeepBoop.nvim!

Have you ever been using God's editor and thought, "Dangit this is dark room im in is so lifeless and sad." No? Well do I have the Neovim plugin for you! Introducing BeepBoop.nvim, the next best thing to happen to your config since [https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon](harpoon). The idea is that I don't have a nice keyboard that makes beutiful chocks, so I wear headphones, but it's also kinda boring listening to nothing when I program, and sometimes I'm not in the music mood. One aspect of games I think is really understated are the sound effects, so it's my goal to bring an aspect of what makes games good to your besutifully bespoke editor.

BeepBoop.nvim is a simple, cross-platform (except windows lol) sound effects plugin for Neovim.
