Of course, I merely jest, the best part about Advent of Code is the puzzles. Puzzles, puzzles, puzzles. And oh how good they are. I often find myself just smiling as I read the problems and the different solutions come rushing to my head, a feeling any programmer who has done Advent of Code can attest to. Here is a small list of some of my very favorite puzzles that I&#39;ve done.

The real computer science teacher quit 3 days because school started, and they had to ask a member of IT to fill the role. Although not a trained teach and lacking the skills to lead a class, I still really enjoyed his class and got to know him a little better outside of class. He played movies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Science_(film">Weird Science</a>), put on a live stream of ShmooCon <a href="https://www.shmoocon.org/">some sort of hacking convention</a>, and of course introduced Advent of Code.

Since then I&#39;ve improved significantly but also have become much more attached to Advent of Code.',P,g,V="The next year I became the president (technically co-president) of the programming club at my high school. If I was going to set up programming related events and activities, Advent of Code <strong>HAD</strong> to be one of them! So of course, the programming club hosted prizes for 1st and 2nd place in the programming club&#39;s private leader board. I even go to invite that IT department member to participate with us and he put me and a friend up to the challenge. We and my fiend would be up till midnight, waiting for the puzzle to drop, and once it did, scrambling to put together a working solution before the IT code wizard. There were times we were able to best him, and other times where we were totally squashed. But it was incredibly fun and challenging.",q,w,X='This year I hope to put together a lot more participation now that I&#39;m in college. I&#39;ve met a lot of people who enjoy computer science enough to want to do it for a living and I&#39;m hoping to get a healthy participating leader board so I can converse, compare, and compete against a bunch of geniuses.

For example, I used Advent of Code to learn C++, and intend to do the same this year. I want to expand into the standard library more, use popular tools like std::string_view, the algorithms header and multithreading (even though it&#39;s probably not necessary). AoC helped me learn vim motions, and I&#39;m pushing many to use this year&#39;s AoC to do the same (I&#39;m not an elitist, I swear). The community is thriving too!
