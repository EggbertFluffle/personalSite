	<h2>&lt;<span>WhoAmI</span>&gt;</h2>
	<p>I am <em>H<span>a</span>rr<span>i</span>s<span>o</span>n D<span>iA</span>mbr<span>o</span>s<span>io</span></em>. A humble programmer interested in all things relative to web development, creative coding, computer graphics, game development and linux. I am all self taught, and have found learning about comptuers to be one of my all time favorite hobbies. I am familliarizing myself with a couple languages, such as C, C++ and TypeScript, but I'm most comfaterble with JavaScript. Additionally, I'm most comfaterble with putting together projects in a web development setting, using SvelteKit and NodeJS/Bun. As of now I'm a graduating highschool senior and plan to study Computer Science in university. Below are some various technologies I take advantage of as a developer and in my workflow.</p>
	<h3>Technologies and Dotfiles</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/nvim">Neovim</a> - Text editor and the only way I can type now. If I need to use anotehr editor I need vim binds, without question. Package management done with <a href="https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim">lazy.nvim</a> which makes the whole configuration process super portable.</li>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a> - My choice for linux distro. Mostly used out of recommendation, but also has a cool logo and I do appreciate the simplicity and speed. I honestly don't find a huge difference between runit and systemd, but I also don't play with init systems often enough.</li>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> - Window manager of choice. Simple, works well, and I love how the config is written in C.</li>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/kitty">Kitty</a> - Just a terminal emulator, I like it for the in built image rendering. It also has nice paneling that can be simmilar to my dwm binds but I don't take advantage of those often.</li>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/saysjonathan/dwm.tmux">dwm.tmux</a> - I use tmux for when I'm on my school chromebook or not in a graphical enviroenment with tiling window management. This nice plugin makes it easy to get keybinds simmilar to dwm and it's a nice set and forget.</li>
